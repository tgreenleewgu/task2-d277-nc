         gateway to Southern California. This road passes through many major cities and state capitals along the way. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a 
         total area of 52.97 square miles (137.2 km2), of which 51.41 square miles (133.2 km2) is land and 1.56 square miles (4.0 km2) (2.95%) is water. Wrightsville Beach is a 
         common destination in the Wilmington area. Carolina Beach and Kure Beach also add to the city's attractions.</p>

            Stretching across nearly two miles, the Riverwalk in Wilmington serves as much more than a picturesque pathway. Originating from an idea conceived in the 1980s to 
            revitalize Wilmington's historic downtown, it has since become the pulsating core of the city. Lined with eateries providing outdoor dining experiences, charming boutique 
            shops, and regular events, the Riverwalk encapsulates Wilmington's lively atmosphere. Moreover, it provides uninterrupted vistas of the scenic Cape Fear River, adding to 
            its allure as a must-visit destination in the city..</p>
