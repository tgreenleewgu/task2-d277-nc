          <p class="city-p"> Romare Bearden Park, spanning 5.4 acres, is a public park situated at 300 S. Church Street in Charlotte, North Carolina. Named after the renowned 
            artist Romare Bearden, a native of Charlotte, the park officially opened its doors in late August 2013. Situated across from Truist Field, the home stadium of the
             International League's Charlotte Knights, the park is located in Uptown Charlotte and hosts a variety of fitness and cultural arts programs throughout the year. 
             Inspired by Bearden's collages and paintings, the park's design was crafted by supervising artist Norie Sato. Among its features are two gardens, a courtyard with 
             dining tables and chairs, a formal event green field, a play area featuring interactive digital chimes, including dance chimes, and several waterfalls. The grand opening 
             celebration occurred on August 31-September 1, 2013.</p>
