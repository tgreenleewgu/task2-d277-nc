    <p class="city-p">According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 149.60 square miles (387.5 km2), of which 148.54 square miles (384.7 km2) is land 
        and 1.07 square miles (2.8 km2) (0.72%) is water. The Neuse River flows through the northeastern corner of the city. Raleigh is located in the northeast central region of 
        North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic coastal plain regions meet. This area is known as the "fall line" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls 
        begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. The city of 
        Raleigh is located 24 mi (39 km) southeast of Durham; 63 mi (101 km) northeast of Fayetteville; 131 mi (211 km) northwest of Wilmington; and 155 mi (249 km) southwest of 
        Richmond, Virginia; and 165 mi (266 km) northeast of Charlotte. A small portion of Raleigh is located in Durham County, North Carolina.</p>

          <p class="city-p"> The Warehouse District, situated in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, is a significant urban area known for its vibrant arts scene, diverse dining options, 
            bustling nightlife, and thriving entrepreneurial spirit. Positioned just three blocks west of the Raleigh Convention Center, this district is characterized by 
            six blocks of expansive red-brick buildings. Most of these structures have been repurposed from their original use as warehouses, factories, and depots, 
            contributing to the district's unique atmosphere and industrial charm.</p>
